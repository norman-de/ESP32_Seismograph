ESP32 Seismograph Data Directory

This directory contains the LittleFS filesystem data.
The system will create the following structure:

/logs/     - System and performance logs
/events/   - Seismic event records  
/data/     - Raw sensor data
/config/   - Configuration files

All files are automatically managed by the system.
